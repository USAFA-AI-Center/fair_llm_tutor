## The Power Rule

The power rule is one of the most fundamental differentiation rules. It states:

**If f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n·x^(n-1)**

### Two-Step Process

The power rule has TWO critical steps that must BOTH be performed:

1. **Multiply the coefficient by the exponent**
2. **Reduce the exponent by 1**

### Example

Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2

Step 1: Multiply coefficient (3) by exponent (2): 3 × 2 = 6
Step 2: Reduce exponent from 2 to 1: x^(2-1) = x^1 = x

Therefore: f'(x) = 6x

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: Forgetting to Reduce the Exponent

**Student Error**: f(x) = 3x^2 → f'(x) = 6x^2

**Problem**: Student correctly multiplied (3 × 2 = 6) but forgot to reduce the exponent.

**Root Cause**: Student treats power rule as a one-step process instead of two steps.

**Teaching Strategy**: Emphasize the TWO steps explicitly. Have students verbalize both steps before applying the rule.

### Misconception 2: Only Handling the Coefficient

**Student Error**: f(x) = 3x^2 → f'(x) = 3x

**Problem**: Student applied some operation to the coefficient but ignored the exponent multiplication.

**Root Cause**: Confusion about how exponents interact with differentiation.

**Teaching Strategy**: Review exponent rules. Emphasize that the exponent multiplies the coefficient.

### Misconception 3: Dropping the Variable

**Student Error**: f(x) = 3x^2 → f'(x) = 6

**Problem**: Student computed 3 × 2 = 6 but lost the x term entirely.

**Root Cause**: Treating the expression as pure arithmetic rather than algebraic.

**Teaching Strategy**: Remind students that derivatives are still functions. The variable must remain unless the derivative is truly a constant.

## The Derivative of a Constant

**Rule**: The derivative of any constant is always zero.

**Explanation**: Constants don't change. Since derivatives measure rate of change, a value that never changes has a rate of change of zero.

**Example**: If f(x) = 5, then f'(x) = 0

### Common Error: Keeping the Constant

**Student Error**: f(x) = 10 → f'(x) = 10

**Problem**: Student thinks the derivative of a constant is the constant itself.

**Teaching Strategy**: Ask "What does a derivative measure?" (rate of change). Then ask "Does this number ever change?" (no). Therefore the rate must be zero.

## Sum Rule

When differentiating a sum of terms, take the derivative of each term separately.

**Rule**: If f(x) = g(x) + h(x), then f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)

### Example

f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x + 7

- Derivative of 5x^3: 15x^2 (power rule)
- Derivative of 2x: 2 (power rule with x^1)
- Derivative of 7: 0 (constant rule)

Therefore: f'(x) = 15x^2 + 2

## Teaching Hints

### Socratic Questions for Power Rule

**Level 1 (Strategic)**: 
- "What mathematical operation measures rate of change?"
- "What rule applies to polynomial terms?"

**Level 2 (Conceptual)**:
- "How many steps does the power rule have?"
- "What does the exponent do in the power rule?"

**Level 3 (Procedural)**:
- "What's the first step? What's the second step?"
- "After multiplying by the exponent, what happens next?"

**Level 4 (Specific)**:
- "Look at your exponent. Did it change?"
- "Check: did you multiply by the exponent AND reduce it?"

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

1. Start with conceptual questions (Level 2)
2. Only move to procedural (Level 3) if conceptual understanding is solid
3. Use specific hints (Level 4) only for minor errors
4. NEVER give Level 5 (the solution itself)

## Assessment Rubric

When evaluating student work on derivatives:

- **Full Credit**: Correct application of both steps of power rule
- **Partial Credit**: Correct process but arithmetic error
- **Limited Credit**: Applied power rule but missed a step
- **No Credit**: No evidence of understanding derivatives

## Practice Problems

1. Find f'(x) if f(x) = 4x^3
2. Find f'(x) if f(x) = x^5 + 3x^2 - 7
3. Find f'(x) if f(x) = -2x^4 + 6x
4. Find f'(x) if f(x) = x
5. Find f'(x) if f(x) = 8

Remember: Always show both steps of the power rule explicitly!
