# Physics Course Materials - Momentum and Newton's Laws

## Momentum

Momentum is a measure of the "quantity of motion" an object has.

**Definition**: Momentum (p) = mass (m) × velocity (v)

**Formula**: p = mv

**Units**: kg·m/s

### Key Concepts

1. **Momentum is a vector**: It has both magnitude and direction
2. **Larger mass OR larger velocity** increases momentum
3. **Both factors matter**: A slow-moving truck can have more momentum than a fast-moving car

### Example

Calculate the momentum of a 5 kg object moving at 10 m/s.

p = mv = 5 kg × 10 m/s = 50 kg·m/s

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: Using Wrong Formula

**Student Error**: Calculating momentum using p = m + v or p = m/v

**Problem**: Student confused momentum with other physics quantities

**Root Cause**: Not understanding what momentum measures (quantity of motion requires BOTH mass AND velocity)

**Teaching Strategy**: 
- Ask: "What two properties determine how much 'motion' something has?"
- Emphasize: Momentum is the PRODUCT, not sum or ratio

### Misconception 2: Forgetting Units

**Student Error**: Stating momentum as just a number (e.g., "50") without units

**Problem**: Missing kg·m/s units

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Always require units in physics
- Practice dimensional analysis
- Ask: "What are you measuring? Motion of WHAT with WHAT speed?"

### Misconception 3: Treating Velocity as Speed

**Student Error**: Using speed instead of velocity (ignoring direction)

**Problem**: Momentum is a vector, so direction matters

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Ask: "Does direction matter for momentum?"
- Discuss: Two cars with same speed but opposite directions have opposite momenta

## Newton's Laws

### First Law (Law of Inertia)

**Statement**: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force.

**Key Point**: Objects "resist" changes in motion

### Second Law (F = ma)

**Statement**: The net force on an object equals its mass times its acceleration.

**Formula**: F_net = ma

**Key Point**: Force CAUSES acceleration, not velocity

### Third Law (Action-Reaction)

**Statement**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Key Point**: Forces always come in pairs

## Common Misconceptions in Newton's Laws

### Misconception: Force Causes Velocity

**Student Error**: Thinking F = mv instead of F = ma

**Problem**: Confusing what force does (changes motion) with motion itself

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Emphasize: Force causes CHANGE in velocity (acceleration), not velocity itself
- Ask: "If you push a box and then stop pushing, does it immediately stop?"

### Misconception: Heavier Objects Fall Faster

**Student Error**: Thinking mass affects free fall acceleration

**Problem**: Not understanding that g is constant (ignoring air resistance)

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Galileo's thought experiment
- Ask: "Why do feathers fall slower?" (air resistance, not mass)

## Teaching Hints

### Socratic Questions for Momentum

**Level 1 (Strategic)**:
- "What does momentum measure in physics?"
- "What two quantities determine motion?"

**Level 2 (Conceptual)**:
- "Momentum is 'quantity of motion.' What makes something have more motion?"
- "Is momentum addition, multiplication, or division of mass and velocity?"

**Level 3 (Procedural)**:
- "What's the formula for momentum?"
- "What units should your answer have?"

**Level 4 (Specific)**:
- "Check your operation: did you multiply or add?"
- "Look at your units: are they kg·m/s?"

### Progressive Disclosure

1. Start with "What are you trying to find?"
2. Then "What formula relates mass, velocity, and momentum?"
3. Only if stuck: "The formula is p = mv. What values do you have?"
4. NEVER: "The answer is 50 kg·m/s"

## Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Identify**: What are you solving for?
2. **List**: What information is given?
3. **Formula**: What equation relates these quantities?
4. **Substitute**: Plug in values
5. **Solve**: Calculate
6. **Check**: Are units correct? Does answer make sense?

## Assessment Rubric

For momentum problems:

- **Full Credit**: Correct formula, correct calculation, correct units
- **Partial Credit**: Correct formula but arithmetic error OR missing units
- **Limited Credit**: Wrong formula but shows understanding of concepts
- **No Credit**: No evidence of understanding momentum

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate momentum of 10 kg object at 5 m/s
2. A 2 kg ball has momentum of 20 kg·m/s. What's its velocity?
3. Two objects have same momentum. One has twice the mass. Compare velocities.
4. Car A (1000 kg at 20 m/s) and Car B (2000 kg at 10 m/s). Which has more momentum?

Remember: Always include units and consider direction for vector quantities!

## Connections to Other Topics

- **Energy**: KE = p²/(2m) relates momentum to kinetic energy
- **Collisions**: Momentum is conserved in all collisions
- **Impulse**: Change in momentum equals impulse (F·Δt)
